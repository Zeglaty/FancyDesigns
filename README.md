# FancyDesigns
#### this project is done only for learning prepossess 
#### another Note: the first screen in each (Animation screens (Pizza screens) & Blured style screens) they should have been implemented over a scrollView but for the sake of learning the new animations and effects i did not do that to give more attention to the main things that i want to do.
the project contains 3 parts
